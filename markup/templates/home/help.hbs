    <p class="H1" dir="ltr">Welcome to Ji Bytes!</p>
    <p class="normal" dir="ltr">This series has been carefully designed for you by expert teachers, to give you and your child access to a safe Jewish learning environment daily. New content will be delivered for Monday to Friday every week designed for children aged 4-9 years old. It should keep them busy for about an hour or so.</p>
    <p class="normal" dir="ltr">The content is designed for you to use in any order you wish and with minimum instruction from you. However, please be aware you may be needed the first few times until your children are familiar with the pattern and tools needed.</p><p class="subheading">Help</p>
    <p class="normal">For any help please first visit our <a href="https://jitap.net/pages/ji_tap_support/" target="_blank">Ji Tap Help Center</a>.&nbsp;If that doesn't help, please <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1p4YvSpH3TWaHeTKUJTzJ7A1kii1" target="_blank">contact us</a> if you have specific queries or challenges with Ji Bytes.</p>
    <p class="subheading">Ji BYTES: A GUIDE FOR PARENTS</p>
        <p class="normal">The Ji Bytes content is split into Themes and Topics.<br>
    For example: Our first Theme is Pesach. One Topic is all about Moses, another Topic is about the 10 Plagues.</p>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="{{PathHelp}}/images/2wyEXPJe3G.png" width="80%"  alt=""/></p>

    <p class="normal">For an optimal learning experience, we recommend that Ji Bytes is best used on a desktop or laptop. Should you not have access to either, it can be used on an iPad or iPhone.<br>	
    Unfortunately Ji Bytes is not yet compatible with Android.</p>
        <p class="subheading">Daily Topics</p>

    <p align="center" ><img src="{{PathHelp}}/images/whole topic page.png" width="80%"  alt=""/></p>
    <p class="normal">Each Ji Bytes Topic is split into 5 activities which are the same every day. This repetition has been structured intentionally so your children become familiar with the layout and will need your input less as the days go on. All of these activities have been designed by expert teachers for independent learning. However your children may need adult support when completing the <strong>Create</strong> and <strong>Craft</strong> sections. The 5 activities are as follows:</p>

        

    <table width="80%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" class="normal" align="center">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td bgcolor="#f2f2f2"><img src="{{PathHelp}}/images/watch.svg" width="20%" alt=""/><br>
        Here your children can sit back and consume content that will set the scene and give over knowledge needed to complete the rest of the tasks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td  bgcolor="#f2f2f2"><img src="{{PathHelp}}/images/games.svg" width="20% alt=""/><br>
            Nothing for you to do here, just let your children play the games! If you have more than one child playing, please ask them to take a turn each, as there are usually 4 games for each day.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#f2f2f2"><img src="{{PathHelp}}/images/discover.svg" width="20%" alt=""/><br>
        These are external links to other informative, safe websites that can help your children with the create activity. It is a research exercise for your children to do that can be used for as long or as little time as you wish.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td valign="top"></td>
